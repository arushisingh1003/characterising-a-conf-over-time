# Characterising a Conference(W4A) over Time

The complete Python code utilised for the data analysis is present in the Charaterising a Conference over Time Jupyter notebook.

The data used is attached as a zip, data.zip which will have to be unzipped and present in the same location as the Jupyter notebok before running the code. This data is the actual data that all the processing was performed on, i.e. the split 4 mini corpora for each 5 year period comprising the XML metadata for each paper.

The original corpus has also been attached as Corpus.zip for reference.

The code requires the following Python packages to be installed before running successfully:
1. numpy
2. spaCy
3. matplotlib
4. scipy
5. pandas
6. requests
7. lxml
8. gensim
9. sklearn
10. seaborn
